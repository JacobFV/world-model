# osm_topology

First100 highway ways in a small San Francisco bounding box; full node IDs and geometry per retained way; bounded subgraph, not global coverage

## Pipeline

Local implementation: [pipeline.py](pipeline.py). Stages: **normalized**; default output: `normalized`. The [dataset.json](dataset.json) declaration pins source configuration, parameters, dependencies and validation.

Dependencies: None (source input).

## Scope and evidence

Source statements retain their provenance, units and available dates. A bounded sample does not establish complete or representative coverage.

## Local files

`artifacts/` contains generated immutable stage products; `scratch/` is temporary local work. Both are ignored by Git. Legacy generated paths are also ignored. Source terms and access requirements remain in `dataset.json`; repository code licensing does not grant dataset redistribution rights.
